# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously throws one of three hand signals: rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The player who wins gets a point, and the first to three points wins the game.
